## Socket stuff
Note: we'll be getting to this in lecture in week 2, so don't worry if you don't know it yet

- If you're not using realtime updating or don't need server->client communication, you can remove socket entirely! (server-socket.js, client-socket.js, and anything that imports them)
- If you are using socket, consider what you want to do with the FIXME in server-socket.js


## don't touch

the following files students do not need to edit. feel free to read them if you would like.

```
client/src/index.js
client/src/utilities.js
client/src/client-socket.js
server/validator.js
server/server-socket.js
.babelrc
.npmrc
.prettierrc
package-lock.json

```

## Good luck on your project :)
